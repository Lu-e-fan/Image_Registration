In this project the goal is to implement an end-to-end image registration system. The system
will be capable of aligning image pairs to a common coordinate system. The project is
divided into different steps (roughly one for each module of the system). This is project is in collabration with Samuel Cheng.

**Included in this repository is a zip containing python script with test and demo images.
